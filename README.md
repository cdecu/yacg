# yacg
Yet another Code generator. It is a spare time project !  
Test site live at https://cdecu.github.io/yacg/  
No it is not yacc :( it is just a small personal project.   
It is just the beginning but the idea is to
- Transform raw text data into code.
  - guess type
  - guess required
  - guess enum

# Build with
- [Nx Workspace](https://nx.dev). (I know it is a bazooka for a small project)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) as code linter.
  and of course node, npm|yarn, ....
