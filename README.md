# yacg
Yet another Code generator. It is a spare time project !    
No it is not yacc :( it is just a small personal project.  
It is just the beginning but the idea is to
- Transform raw text data into code.
  - guess type  
  - guess required
  - guess enum

# Build with
  - [Nx Workspace](https://nx.dev). (I know it is a bazooka for a small project)
  - [jest](https://jestjs.io/) as testing framework.
  - [eslint](https://eslint.org/) as code linter.
  - [prettier](https://prettier.io/) as code formatted.    
and of course node, npm|yarn, webpack, ....
